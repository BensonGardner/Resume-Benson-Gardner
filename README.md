# Interactive Resume
This is an interactive resume I created in 2016. 

## Why an Interactive Resume?
I have always felt an inherent tension in the job-application process, between: 
1. the need to provide employers with a complete picture of one's experience, and
2. the need to make that information easily digestible.

That's the idea behind the filtering functionality of this resume. Now you, as an employer, can see the depth of my experience with particular skills of interest. 

## Background
Although the online resume itself was a project created as part of a Udacity.com Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, filtering was my own innovation. The assignment's intended focus was on using jQuery to alter HTML content and styling, so I did some independent learning to implement this customization.
