NEXGT STEPS
amke sure I'm appending everything correcty. Shouldn't I  be using innerHTML to put all the things insde of the divs that the "start" elemnets create?

finish the online courses and other trianig sections

make sure eferything is as should be

then you can start setting up the interactivity -- make sure you can get the skills to select the jobs and projects - use some
simple styling to make it obvious.

then after that you can actually make the styling what you want it to be.

but remember to design for mobile first!


NEED TO CHECK d3 and try my other ideas for customization
  ALSO : assignments for final project are 1) Encapsulate all the display functionality -
  and it looks like I never did it fo reducation -- or even projects??, and
  2) customize. I can look at esxisting js libraries. And I could  make my own stuff too.
  Lots of style stuff to do better.
 BETTER not to have images in the resume?

Grunt and/or gulp, or leave for later?
  add awards/achievements to resume -- expandable? definitely not filterable
  get the funcionality going in terms of selecting-  use a background color for starters
   style the whole thing

/* ideas include pitching myself for up and coming jobs including speech command stuff, able to tackle frontiers */
