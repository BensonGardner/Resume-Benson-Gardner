<!--NEED TO CHECK d3 and try my other ideas for customization
  ALSO : assignments for final project are 1) Encapsulate all the display functionality -
  and it looks like I never did it fo reducation -- or even projects??, and
  2) customize. I can look at esxisting js libraries. And I could  make my own stuff too.
  Lots of style stuff to do better.
  BETTER not to have images in the resume?-->

<!-- Next steps: find all your notes to self and put them in one palce, maybe a
  separate README file since this is getting ridiculous.
  Set up Git
  Also gotta get going with grunt and gulp, dont I??
  add awards/achievements to resume -- expandable?
  get the funcionality going in terms of selecting-  use a background color for starters
   style the whole thing
-->

/* ideas include pitching myself for up and coming jobs including speech command stuff, able to tackle frontiers */
/* should i have an awards section too? Yes, but filterable probably not - becuase tey tend to emphasize stuff earlier in myc areer*/

NEXT STEPS:
/*  REvision: set up Git. */
